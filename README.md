App for learning new words in a language by repetition

The idea:
- Get quized on random words
- Select the words you don't know
- Get quized on these words repeatedly untill you can easily remember them

There are two simmilar apps:
1) WordUp: I've been using it for a while but I don't like certain parts and want to improve it.
2) Anki: after a quick look it seems to be ment for memorizing anything, not words specifically. This app will be ment specifically for words so it can be more convenient to use.
